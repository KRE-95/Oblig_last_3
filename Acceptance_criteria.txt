Acceptance criteria:

A year is a leap year

When divideable with 4, but not 100

When divideable with 400

(For example, the year 2000 was a leap year).

A year is not a leap year:

When it is not devideable with 4

When it's 100, but not 400.

(For example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 leap years were not, nor was 2100 )

use TDD to write function by using python, pytest:

bool isLeapYear(int year)



Algorithm:

In the end of the leap.py file , it became a lot of bool and alot of code of lines.
What I did first is to try how, can I make my code simpler as long it still does the task,
and how can I remove the repetitive code of the if and return .

1) how to make the code into a single line
2) how to remove repetitive to a single .


e.g. (before)

   return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False


 NOW: after implementing

  if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
